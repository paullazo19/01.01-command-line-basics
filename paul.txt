Hi, my name is Paul. I'm from San Antonio, TX. A "fun fact" about me is that I love stand-up comedy. I've never done it (probably never will), but I listen to it all the time. The structure of jokes is fascinating to me. Like comedy, coding has a lot to do about structure.

At The Iron Yard, I want to learn how to use the powerful medium of the web to communicate with people around the world. Coding is a remarkable tool because it makes the earth navigable in an instant without minimizing the vastness and majesty of the planet.
